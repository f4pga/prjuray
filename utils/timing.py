""" Route timing delay definitions.

Routing delay is formed from two parts in this model:

- Intristic delay of the element
- Capactive loading delay of the net

Intristic delay is a time value (e.g. nanoseconds), does not vary based on
routing fanout.  It does vary based on the PVT (process, voltage, temperature)
corner.  PvtCorner and IntristicDelay objects are used to model intristic
delay of elements.

Capactive loading is the elmore delay from the RC tree formed by interconnect.
The RC tree is made up of 5 types of RC nodes:


|Element type          |Object        |Intrinsic delays?|Output resistance?|Capacitance type    |
|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|
|Site output pin       |Outpin        |Yes              |Yes               |N/A                 |
|Buffered switch       |Buffer        |Yes              |Yes               |Internal capacitance|
|Pass-transistor switch|PassTransistor|Yes              |Yes               |N/A                 |
|Wire                  |Wire          |No               |Yes               |Pi model            |
|Site input pin        |Inpin         |Yes              |No                |Input capacitance   |

The elmore delay is the RC tree formed by these 5 components.  Out pins and
buffer switches are the roots of the elmore tree. Buffer switches
and inpins are leafs of the elmore tree. Wires and pass-transistor switches are
nodes in the tree. Wires share their capacitance upstream and downstream using
a pi-model.

    +--+--+          +--+--+
    |Inpin|          |Inpin|
    +-----+          +-----+

Note on units:

The timing model operates on the following types of units:
 - Time
 - Resistance
 - Capacitance

For a consistent unit set, the following equation must be satisfied:

1 Resistance unit * 1 Capacitance unit = 1 Time unit

The SI unit set would be:
 - Time = seconds
 - Resistance = Ohms
 - Capacitance = Farads

However as long as the scale factors are consistent, the model will work
with other unit combinations.  For example:
 - Time = nanoseconds (1e-9 seconds)
 - Resistance = milliOhms (1e-3 Ohms)
 - Capacitance = microFarads (1e-6 Farads)

(1e-3 * 1e-6) (Ohms * Farads) does equal (1e-9) seconds.
