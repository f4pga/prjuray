Welcome to Project U-Ray
=========================================

`Project U-Ray`_ documents the `Xilinx`_ US and US+ Series FPGA architecture to enable
development of open-source tools.  Our goal is to provide sufficient information
to develop a free and open Verilog to bitstream toolchain for these devices.
